Configuration is supplied to `prepareContext`; structured sample callbacks declare their required derivative order.
Coefficient costs bind statically. The internal quadrature call chain uses a local GCC/Clang flatten annotation
because GCC 9 otherwise loses flatness inlining. Other compilers retain the ordinary C++ path.
Independent samplers borrow immutable polynomials; rebuild them after source mutation or move. No shared prewarming is needed.
`backwardGradInto` writes preallocated spatial gradients; domain penalties add to existing gradients.
The regression reproduces the previous domain-penalty overwrite and checks complete mapped finite differences.

To synchronize, copy the three source headers and license notices from the recorded upstream commit,
update these hashes, migrate adapters if protocols changed, and run the mapped-gradient and planner regressions.
Do not restore an older snapshot over the merged numerical failure, interval or convex-hull functionality.

Validation: Ubuntu 20.04 / GCC 9.4 / Noetic Release backend_equivalence builds and three stability cases pass;
`super_spline_map_regression` passes. Clean builds now depend on generated quadrotor messages.
Whole-solve medians range from 7.5% faster to 3.3% slower in the tested cases; the gradient fix changes evaluation counts.
